I am research fellow at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland), currently working on the project "The semantics of deverbal nouns in French" (PI: prof. Richard Huyghe) funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Previously, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Torino and University of Florence.

My research interests include derivational morphology, distributional semantics, and the development of language resources.
